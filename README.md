# Search everywhere

The extension is inspired by JetBrains IDEs feature "Search Everywhere".
It allows user to easily navigate through files and symbols in the whole workspace.

It is the alternative for "Go to Symbol in Workspace..." - fully customizable.


Version 2.0.0 - rewritten with several fancy new features.

## How it works

The extension indexes the whole workspace. It scans both files and all symbols for each file according to set up patterns in settings. The scan can be initialized automatically on startup of Visual Studio Code or postponed till the first launch of extension.

After the scan is completed, the extension listens for any change in the workplace, e.g.

* add, rename, delete function, variable or anything other in file
* add, rename, delete, move a file between directories or even between projects in the opened workspace

The above guarantees that the data is always up to date.


Worth mentioning is the optimization of scanning algorithm. It queues every change and reduces not necessary actions to assure the scan is smooth and very quick.

Additionally from version 2.0.0 there is a feature to scan the workspace only once and cache the results. Useful especially with the bigger projects.

## Commands

* `searchEverywhere.search`

  Search any symbol/file in the currently opened workspace.

  Default keybinding for the command is:
  * mac: `alt + cmd + p`
  * win/linux: `ctrl + alt + p`

* `searchEverywhere.reload`

  Re-index the whole workspace.

## Extension Settings

Should the selected symbol be highlighted.
Default value: `false`.

* `searchEverywhere.shouldUseDebounce`

Should the debounce function be used while returning filter results (useful in case of the large workspace).
Default value: `true`.

* `searchEverywhere.icons`

Ability to define icons that should be displayed for appropriate item types. According to VSC API, only Octicons are allowed. Not defined item type will not have any icon.
